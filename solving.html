        <h2>Don't Panic‚ÄîSolving the Cube Is Possible!</h2>
        <p>
          You might've thought solving a Rubik's Cube is some genius-level
          trick‚Ä¶ but it's actually a step-by-step process that <i>anyone</i> can
          learn. No guessing needed‚Äîjust some simple moves, called
          <strong>algorithms</strong>, and a bit of practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          We'll walk you through the beginner method, which focuses on solving
          the cube layer by layer.

      <section id="moves" class="row border-top mt-2 pt-3">
        <h2>Cube Notation (The Moves)</h2>
        <p>Before we start, here's how we describe cube moves:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>F</strong> - Front face</li>
          <li><strong>B</strong> - Back face</li>
          <li><strong>U</strong> - Upper face</li>
          <li><strong>D</strong> - Down face</li>
          <li><strong>L</strong> - Left face</li>
          <li><strong>R</strong> - Right face</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each letter simply tells you to move that face
          <strong>clockwise</strong> by <strong>90 degrees</strong>.
        </p>
        <div
          class="d-flex flex-wrap justify-content-center justify-content-sm-start"

            class="solving-image"
            alt="Rotations representation"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          If a letter has <span class="badge text-bg-light">'</span> (a prime)
          after it, it means a counter-clockwise turn. No
          <span class="badge text-bg-light">'</span> = clockwise. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>R</strong> = turn right face clockwise</li>
          <li><strong>R'</strong> = turn right face counter-clockwise</li>

        <h2>Step 1: Solve the White Cross</h2>
        <p>
          First step: build a <strong>white cross</strong> on the white face by
          placing the four <strong>white edge pieces</strong> around the white
          center.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it's not just about getting the white stickers on top ‚Äî each edge
          also needs to match the <strong>center color</strong> on its side.

          <p class="border rounded bg-body-tertiary p-3">
            <strong>Tip:</strong> The center pieces don't move‚Äîthey define the

      <section id="bottom" class="row border-top mt-2 pt-3">
        <h2>Step 2: Solve the White Corners</h2>
        <p>
          Now that you've made a white cross, it's time to finish the whole
          white face by solving the <strong>four white corners</strong>. <br />
          Your goal is to place each <strong>white corner piece</strong> between
          the correct center colors ‚Äî so that the colors on the corner match the
          sides around it.

          </div>
        </div>
        <h5>What to Do:</h5>
        <p>
          Sometimes, a white corner will already be in the bottom layer ‚Äî just
          not in the right spot or orientation.<br />
          Here's how to fix that:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Find a white corner piece</strong> in the top layer.</li>
          <li>
            Turn the top face so it's
            <strong>right above where it belongs</strong> (for example, the
            white-blue-red piece goes above the white-blue-red corner).
          </li>
          <li>
            Then, depending on how the white sticker is facing, use one of these
            quick moves:
          </li>
        </ol>
        <div
          class="d-flex flex-wrap justify-content-center justify-content-md-start"
        >
          <div class="text-center">
            <p>If the white is on the <strong>side</strong>:</p>
            <img
              src="assets/images/solving/white-on-side.png"
              class="solving-image"
              alt="White on side"
            />

          </div>
          <div class="text-center">
            <p>If on the <strong>right face</strong>:</p>
            <img
              src="assets/images/solving/white-on-right.png"
              class="solving-image"
              alt="White on right"
            />
            <p><strong>R' D' R</strong></p>
          </div>
          <div class="text-center">
            <p>If on the <strong>bottom</strong>:</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Repeat this for each corner until your white face is fully solved ‚Äî
          and the first layer wraps neatly around it!
        </p>

        <div>
          <p class="border rounded bg-body-tertiary p-3">
            <strong>Tip:</strong> If a corner is already in the bottom layer but
            in the wrong spot or facing the wrong way, no problem. <br />Just
            use <i>any</i> of the moves above to ‚Äúpop it out‚Äù, then use the
            right move to place it back correctly.

        <h2>Step 3: Solve the Middle Layer Edges</h2>
        <p>Awesome ‚Äî the white face and first layer are done! üéâ</p>
        <p>
          Now it's time to fill in the <strong>middle layer edges</strong> (the
          pieces between the centers, without any yellow on them).
        </p>
        <div

        <p>
          Your goal here is to move edge pieces from the top layer into the
          middle layer ‚Äî placing them between matching center pieces on each
        </p>
        <p>
          The top face (usually yellow) should still be scrambled, and we'll now
          be using it to find and insert the correct edges into the middle.
        </p>

        <h5>Step-by-Step:</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Look at the top layer</strong> for edge pieces that
            <strong>don't have yellow</strong> on them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once you find one, match its <strong>front color</strong> with the
            center piece on that face (by turning the top layer left or right).
          </li>
          <li>
            Then, check which side the other color needs to go ‚Äî
            <strong>left or right</strong>. Use the right move below depending
            on the direction.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Step 4: Make a Yellow Cross</h2>
        <p>
          Now that the first two layers are done, it's time to work on the
          <strong>yellow face</strong> (the top). The goal for this step is to
          create a <strong>yellow cross</strong> ‚Äî like the white one you made
          earlier, but on top!

        <p>Depending on how your cube looks, you might see one of these:</p>
        <ul>

        <h5>The Move to Use:</h5>
        <p>
          No matter which shape you start with, you'll use the same short
          algorithm:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>F R U R' U' F'</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Do this one or more times to turn the yellow dot, L, or line into a
          full cross.
        </p>

        <h5>What to Remember:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you see the <strong>L shape</strong>, hold it so it looks like a
            <strong>backwards L</strong>
            (facing the top-left corner).
          </li>
          <li>
            If you see the <strong>line</strong>, make sure it's
            <strong>horizontal</strong>, not vertical.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repeat the move until all four yellow edge pieces are facing up.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div>
          <p class="border rounded bg-body-tertiary p-3">
            <strong>Tip:</strong> It might take a couple of tries ‚Äî and that's
            normal! Just keep using the move above until the yellow cross
            appears.

          <strong>side colors</strong> of the yellow
          <strong>edge pieces</strong> ‚Äî so they match the center pieces on each
          face.
        </p>
        <p>
          The yellow stickers are already facing up, but they might be in the

          Turn the <strong>top face</strong> to see if any yellow edge piece
          <strong>matches the center color</strong> underneath it.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>If <strong>one or more edge pieces match</strong>, great!</li>
          <li>
            If <strong>none of them match</strong>, don't worry ‚Äî you'll still
            use the same move to fix them.

            Try turning the <strong>top layer (U)</strong> until at least one
            edge matches the face color below.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hold the cube so that
            <strong>solved edge is on the back face</strong>.

          <li>Do the move above ‚Äî and check again.</li>

            You might need to repeat the move once or twice to get all four edge
            pieces lined up correctly.

            <strong>Tip:</strong> If nothing matches at the start, just do the
            move from any angle ‚Äî it should fix at least one piece, and then you
            can try again with that one at the back.

        <h2>Step 6: Position the Yellow Corners</h2>
        <p>You're almost there ‚Äî just one layer to go!</p>
        <p>
          Now it's time to make sure all four yellow
          <strong>corner pieces</strong> are in the
          <strong>right spots</strong> on the top layer. That means each one
          should be <strong>between the correct center colors</strong>, even if
          the yellow sticker isn't facing up yet.

          üëâ We're only <strong>placing</strong> the corners correctly for now.
          We'll rotate them in the next step.
        </p>

        <h5>What to Look For:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Look at each yellow corner piece and check the
            <strong>three colors</strong> on it.
          </li>
          <li>
            See if it belongs between the
            <strong>matching center colors</strong> of the three surrounding
            faces.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You might already have <strong>one corner in the right place</strong>,
          or none at all ‚Äî that's okay!
        </p>

        <h5>The Move to Use:</h5>

          This move <strong>cycles three corners</strong> around the top layer,
          without changing their orientation.

        <h5>üîÅ What to Do:</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>
            If one corner is already in the right place,

              face</strong

          <li>Do the algorithm above.</li>

        </ol>

        <div>
          <p class="border rounded bg-body-tertiary p-3">
            <strong>Tip:</strong> If no corners are in the right spot at first,
            just do the move once from any angle. That usually gets one piece
            into place so you can continue from there.

          All your pieces should now be in the right spots. The only thing left
          is to <strong>twist the yellow corner</strong>s so the yellow stickers
          face up, and the cube is fully solved.

          You might need to do it <strong>2 or 4 times</strong> to fully turn

            Do <strong>R' D' R D repeatedly</strong> until the yellow part is

          <li>
            <strong>Only turn the top face (U)</strong> to move the
            <strong>next unsolved corner</strong> into the top-right ‚Äî keep the
            rest of the cube in the same orientation.

            <strong>Tip:</strong> Don't panic if the rest of the cube looks
