        <h4>🙌 Don't Panic—Solving the Cube Is Possible!</h4>
        <p>
          You might've thought solving a Rubik's Cube is some genius-level
          trick… but it's actually a step-by-step process that <i>anyone</i> can
          learn. No guessing needed—just some simple moves, called
          <strong>algorithms</strong>, and a bit of practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          We'll walk you through the beginner method, which focuses on solving
          the cube layer by layer.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="moves" class="row">
        <h4>🔧 Cube Notation (The Moves)</h4>
        <p>Before we start, here's how we describe cube moves:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>F - Front face</li>
          <li>B - Back face</li>
          <li>U - Upper face</li>
          <li>D - Down face</li>
          <li>L - Left face</li>
          <li>R - Right face</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each letter simply tells you to move that face clockwise by 90
          degrees.
        </p>
        <div
          class="d-flex flex-wrap justify-content-center justify-content-sm-start"

            class="solving-image"
            alt="Rotations representation"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          If a letter has ' (a prime) after it, it means a counter-clockwise
          turn. No ' = clockwise. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>R = turn right face clockwise</li>
          <li>R' = turn right face counter-clockwise</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="cross" class="row">
        <h4>🟡 Step 1: Solve the White Cross</h4>
        <p>
          Start by making a white “plus” on the white face, aligning each white
          edge piece with the center of its neighboring face.
        </p>
        <div
          class="d-flex flex-wrap justify-content-center justify-content-sm-start"

        <h4>🟨 Step 2: Solve the White Corners</h4>
        <p>
          Now that you've made a white cross, it's time to finish the whole
          white face by solving the four white corners. <br />
          Your goal is to place each white corner piece between the correct
          center colors — so that the colors on the corner match the sides
          around it.

        </div>
        <h6>🔍 What to Do:</h6>
        <p>
          Sometimes, a white corner will already be in the bottom layer — just
          not in the right spot or orientation.
        </p>
        <p>Here's how to fix that:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Find a white corner piece in the top layer.</li>
          <li>
            Turn the top face so it's right above where it belongs (for example,
            the white-blue-red piece goes above the white-blue-red corner).
          </li>
          <li>
            Then, depending on how the white sticker is facing, use one of these
            quick moves:
          </li>
        </ol>
        <div
          class="d-flex flex-wrap justify-content-center justify-content-md-start"
        >
          <div class="text-center">
            <p>If the white is on the side:</p>
            <img
              src="assets/images/solving/white-on-side.png"
              class="solving-image"
              alt="White on side"
            />
            <p><strong>F D F'</strong></p>
          </div>
          <div class="text-center">
            <p>If on the right face:</p>
            <img
              src="assets/images/solving/white-on-right.png"
              class="solving-image"
              alt="White on right"
            />
            <p><strong>R' D' R</strong></p>
          </div>
          <div class="text-center">
            <p>If on the bottom:</p>
            <img

            <p><strong>R' D R F D2 F'</strong></p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Repeat this for each corner until your white face is fully solved —
          and the first layer wraps neatly around it!
        </p>
        <p>
          ✅ Tip: If a corner is already in the bottom layer but in the wrong
          spot or facing the wrong way, no problem. Just use any of the moves
          above to “pop it out”, then use the right move to place it back
          correctly.

        <h4>🟦 Step 3: Solve the Middle Layer Edges</h4>
        <p>
          Now it's time to fill in the middle layer edges (the pieces between
          the centers, without any yellow on them).
        </p>

          />
        </div>
        <p>
          Your goal here is to move edge pieces from the top layer into the
          middle layer — placing them between matching center pieces on each
        </p>
        <p>
          The top face (usually yellow) should still be scrambled, and we'll now
          be using it to find and insert the correct edges into the middle.
        </p>
        <h6>🧩 Step-by-Step:</h6>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Look at the top layer for edge pieces that don't have yellow on
            them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once you find one, match its front color with the center piece on
            that face (by turning the top layer left or right).
          </li>
          <li>
            Then, check which side the other color needs to go — left or right.
            Use the right move below depending on the direction.
          </li>
        </ol>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Repeat this process until all four middle layer edges are in the
          correct positions!
        </p>
        <p>
          ✅ Tip: If a middle edge is in the wrong spot or flipped, just use one
          of the moves above to pop it out — then place it again the right way.
          Just like you did with the corners!

      <section id="top-cross" class="row">
        <h4>🟠 Step 4: Make a Yellow Cross</h4>
        <p>
          Now that the first two layers are done, it's time to work on the
          yellow face (the top). The goal for this step is to create a yellow
          cross — like the white one you made earlier, but on top!
        </p>
        <div
          class="d-flex flex-wrap justify-content-center justify-content-sm-start"

          You don't need to worry about the corner pieces yet — just the yellow
          edge pieces.
        </p>
        <h6>🔍 What You Might See:</h6>
        <p>Depending on how your cube looks, you might see one of these:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A single yellow dot in the center</li>
          <li>A small yellow backwards L shape</li>
          <li>A horizontal yellow line</li>
          <li>Or maybe you already have a full yellow cross (lucky you!)</li>
        </ul>

          </div>
        </div>
        <h6>💡 The Move to Use:</h6>
        <p>
          No matter which shape you start with, you'll use the same short
          algorithm:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>F R U R' U' F'</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Do this one or more times to turn the yellow dot, L, or line into a
          full cross.
        </p>
        <h6>🔁 What to Remember:</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you see the L shape, hold it so it looks like a backwards L
            (facing the top-left corner).
          </li>
          <li>If you see the line, make sure it's horizontal, not vertical.</li>
          <li>
            Repeat the move until all four yellow edge pieces are facing up.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          ✅ Tip: It might take a couple of tries — and that's normal! Just keep
          using the move above until the yellow cross appears.

          />
        </div>
        <p>
          Now that you've got a yellow cross, the next goal is to line up the
          side colors of the yellow edge pieces — so they match the center
          pieces on each face.
        </p>
        <p>
          The yellow stickers are already facing up, but they might be in the
          wrong places around the sides.
        </p>

        <h6>🔍 What to Look For:</h6>
        <p>
          Turn the top face to see if any yellow edge piece matches the center
          color underneath it.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>If one or more edge pieces match, great!</li>
          <li>
            If none of them match, don't worry — you'll still use the same move
            to fix them.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h6>🔄 The Move to Use:</h6>

          This will cycle three edge pieces (all except one in the back)
          clockwise.
        </p>

        <h6>🔁 What to Do:</h6>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Try turning the top layer (U) until at least one edge matches the
            face color below.
          </li>
          <li>Hold the cube so that solved edge is on the back face.</li>
          <li>Do the move above — and check again.</li>
          <li>
            You might need to repeat the move once or twice to get all four edge
            pieces lined up correctly.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          ✅ Tip: If nothing matches at the start, just do the move from any
          angle — it should fix at least one piece, and then you can try again
          with that one at the back.

        <h4>🔄 Step 6: Position the Yellow Corners Correctly</h4>
        <p>
          Now that they're all yellow, we need to move them to their correct
          locations (without rotating them). <br />
          Use:
        </p>
        <p>U R U' L' U R' U' L</p>
        <p>Repeat until the corners are in the right places.</p>

        <h4>🧩 Step 7: Finish the Cube (Position Yellow Edges)</h4>
        <p>
          Last step! You'll rotate the top edges into the correct positions.
          Sometimes, you'll need to perform the final algorithm multiple times.
          <br />
          Algorithm:
