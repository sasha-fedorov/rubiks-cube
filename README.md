## Tools & Services

- **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** — used as the main code editor for development
- **[Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools)** — used for debugging, testing website features and responsiveness 
- **[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)** — used to create site favicon and documentation images
- **[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)** — helped generate written content (but not code) for the website pages and this README
- **[WebP Converter](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp)** — used to resize and compress images for web optimization
- **[Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive)** — used to create website mockup for documentation


## Validation & Testing


I also performed **HTML and CSS validation** using the **[W3C Web Validator extension ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CelianRiboulet.webvalidator)** for VS Code during development, and double-checked the final deployed version with the official **[W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)** and **[W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)** to ensure clean, standards-compliant code. All tests passed with no errors or warnings.

During development, I used **[Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools)** to test and debug the website across different screen sizes and devices. This helped identify and fix various layout bugs, alignment issues, and visual inconsistencies. Most of these improvements are documented in the project's **commit history**.

To evaluate and enhance the site’s performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO, I ran **[Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse)** audits using the deployed on GitHub Pages version of the website. The final Lighthouse scores were all **97 or higher**, and changes made to improve these results can also be found in the commit history.
