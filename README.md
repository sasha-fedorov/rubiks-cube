## Design

This section details the visual and interactive design choices implemented across the website, focusing on creating a clean, minimalist, and educational experience.

### Color Scheme

The primary inspiration for the website's color scheme was to achieve a **clean, minimalist look** that fosters a **calming educational environment** and avoids overwhelming the visitor. This was largely achieved by leveraging the default Bootstrap 5 color palette.

- **Bootstrap Defaults:** The design primarily utilizes Bootstrap's default colors, emphasizing a light and uncluttered aesthetic.
  - **Header and Footer Background:** `bg-body-tertiary: #f8f9fa` provides a subtle, light backdrop for global navigation and copyright information.
  - **Card Backgrounds (Solving Page):** Also `bg-body-tertiary: #f8f9fa`, maintaining consistency and visual lightness for instructional cards.
  - **Links in table:** Default link colors were overridden to `bs-dark: #212529` in the World Record table to reduce visual clutter and integrate seamlessly with the minimalist theme.
  - **Credits:** The copyright text in the top and/or bottop of the page employs a dark shade `body-secondary: #595C5F` (75% opacity of `bs-dark: #212529`). This choice supports readability and reinforces the calm, uncluttered educational environment by keeping the focus on the primary content.
- **Accent Colors (Bootstrap Themed):**
  - **Current World Record in Table:** Highlighted using background color `table-succes: #d1e7dd` to gently draw attention to the most recent achievement.
  - **"Watch Current WR" Button:** Styled with `btn-success: #198754` to provide a clear, actionable call-to-action without being overly vibrant.

![Color scheme](./documentation/images/color-scheme.webp)

- **Favicon:** Even the website's favicon (a Rubik's Cube) adheres to Bootstrap's primary colors:

  - Top Face: `bs-primary: #0d6efd`
  - Right Face: `bs-warning: #ffc107`
  - Left Face: `bs-danger: #dc3545`

![Favicon color scheme](./documentation/images/favicon-color-scheme.webp)

### Typography

The website's typography is predominantly based on **Bootstrap's standard typography**, chosen for its **concise and light appearance**, which aligns with the goal of reducing visual load and enhancing readability.

- **Default Bootstrap Fonts:** Standard Bootstrap font families are used for general text, ensuring broad browser compatibility and legibility.
- **Custom Adjustments for Readability:**

  - **H1 Headings:** Reduced to `2.5rem` and `2rem` for small screens correspondingly to lessen visual strain and prevent pages from appearing too heavy.
  - **General Bold Text:** Font weight reduced from default `700` to `600` for most bolded text, contributing to the overall lighter visual load.

    ![Typography example](./documentation/images/typography.webp)

  - **Solving Page Combinations:** Specific combinations on the Solving page maintain a `font-weight: 700` but have increased `word-spacing: 0.5rem`. This ensures these critical sequences are easily discernible and highly readable as distinct combinations.

    ![Combination example](./documentation/images/combination.webp)

### Imagery

Imagery across the website is selected and optimized to support the educational purpose while maintaining a **minimalist aesthetic and low visual load**.

- **Main Page Hero Image:**

  - A custom photograph, taken by the developer, is used for the hero section. This image intentionally mirrors the Rubik's Cube orientation seen in the favicon, creating a subtle visual consistency.
  - It is responsively cropped (wider for larger resolutions) to optimize space utilization on bigger screens, ensuring it remains impactful without dominating the layout.
  - Its minimalist nature contributes to the site's overall low visual load, providing a clear visual representation of the Rubik's Cube without being distracting.

![Typography example](./documentation/images/index-images-resize.webp)

- **Solving Page Images:**

  - Images illustrating solving steps are sourced directly from the reference guide (`SolveTheCube.com`), chosen specifically for their **minimalistic and highly understandable visual representations** of cube states and orientations (before and after applying combinations).
  - Their purpose is to provide clear, step-by-step visual guidance, crucial for users learning the method.

    ![Solving images example](./documentation/images/solving-images.webp)

- **Speedcubing Page Images:**

  - **Competitor Pictures:** These are the most vibrant images on the site, due to their source. However, they are accepted in this context as the Speedcubing page is more information-dense, and these photos enhance the personal connection to the "legends."
  - **Competitor Region Flags:** Sourced from OpenMoji, these flag emojis were chosen for their **minimalistic design**, which helps to save space in the World Record table while concisely conveying regional information.

### Features (Design Aspect)

The website was designed with a **mobile-first approach**, ensuring core usability and responsiveness across all devices, from mobile to desktop. Key design decisions enhance content readability and user interaction:

- **Section Separation:** Each major section on every page is clearly **separated by a horizontal line**. This visual cue makes it clear where one topic ends and the next begins, aiding user navigation and comprehension (e.g., "Want to Learn How to Solve It" from "Fun Facts Corner" on the Main page, each step on the Solving page).
- **Centering vs. Left Alignment:**
  - On **small screens**, all content blocks are **aligned to the center** to keep the focus in the middle of the viewport, optimizing for mobile readability.
  - On **medium and large screens**, blocks are **left-aligned**. This prevents eye movement back and forth across the screen in search of visual representations or combinations, allowing users to keep their focus near the text they are reading.
- **Main Page - Fun Facts:**
  - Designed as a simple unordered list where the main topic of each fact is **highlighted with bold text**. This allows users to quickly scan and spot categories of interest, even if they are just Browse.
- **Solving Page - Instructional Highlights:**
  - Images of current/finished steps, combinations, and tips are **highlighted with a border and a light gray background**. This design decision ensures these crucial elements are easily discoverable, visually distinct, and serve as key reference points for both new learners and advanced users returning for specific content.
- **Speedcubing Page - World Record Table:**

  - The table is **responsive but disables word wrap** and introduces a **horizontal scrollbar** when content exceeds display width. This approach was chosen because compressing columns made information unreadable. The most critical information (date, time, competitor name, and region) remains visible, with less vital details like "competition" being the first to hide.
  - **Flag Emojis:** The use of flag emojis for competitor regions efficiently saves space while still providing intuitive visual information.

    ![Tables comparison](./documentation/images/tables-comparison.webp)

- **Speedcubing Page - Competitor Cards:**

  - These cards serve as a **visual extension of the World Record table**, introducing important names with key information and interesting facts.
  - Their design is **responsive**, arranging them side-by-side on larger screens and stacking them vertically on smaller screens, maintaining a consistent image-to-content ratio and aesthetic.

    ![Tables comparison](./documentation/images/cube-legends-layout.webp)

- **Speedcubing Page - Human Solve WR Video:**

  - The video is **hidden under a button**, reducing initial page load time and offering an interactive element. This also saves valuable screen space for users who may not wish to view the video immediately.

    ![Button interaction](./documentation/images/human-solve-interaction.webp)

- **Speedcubing Page - Robotic Solve Video:**

  - This video utilizes a **responsive layout based on its 9:16 (YouTube Shorts) format**, optimizing viewing experience. On larger screens, it's placed to the right of the record details; on smaller screens, it moves below.

### Accessibility

Accessibility was a key consideration in the website's development, aiming to provide a positive experience for all users, including those with visual impairments and color blindness. Beyond the excellent Lighthouse scores already achieved (all 97 or higher), specific measures were taken:

- **Semantic HTML:** Intentionally utilized semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`) to improve document structure and screen reader navigation.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** The website is designed to be fully navigable using only a keyboard, with clear focus states for interactive elements (links, buttons).
- **Alt Text for Images:** Descriptive `alt` text is provided for all meaningful images, ensuring screen reader users understand visual content.
- **High Contrast Ratios:** Careful attention was paid to color contrast, particularly for text against background, to ensure readability for users with various visual conditions, including color blindness. For instance, the footer copyright text was intentionally darkened for better contrast.
- **Information Conveyed Beyond Color:** Recognizing the color-centric nature of the Rubik's Cube itself, no essential information is conveyed solely by color on the website.
  - On the **Solving page**, textual descriptions and algorithms are detailed enough to guide users regardless of their ability to distinguish specific cube colors in the accompanying images.
  - On the **Speedcubing page**, elements like the "current world record" in the table are distinguished not only by a background color (`.table-success`) but also by their position and context. Links are differentiated by underline and distinct dark color, not just a default blue.
- **Responsive Design:** The mobile-first approach ensures the content reflows and elements stack appropriately on various screen sizes, preventing usability issues for users on smaller devices or those requiring zoomed views.
- **Character Compatibility:** Replaced curly typographic characters (`â€“`, `â€™`) with standard hyphens (`-`) and apostrophes (`'`) to ensure compatibility with screen readers and reduce potential visual noise.
- **Redesigned Links:** Links within the world record table were redesigned to be clearer and more accessible.
- **Reduced Main Heading Font Sizes:** `H1` font sizes were reduced to lessen visual strain on users.
- **Color Blindness Testing:** The website was reviewed using browser extensions (e.g., [mention specific extension if you used one, like "Colorblindly"](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorblindly/flblfmgccjefgfpjngpghcllgnzpjgnj)) to simulate various types of color blindness, ensuring key information and UI elements remain discernible.

### Lighthouse

To evaluate and enhance the siteâ€™s performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO, I ran **[Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse)** audits using the deployed version on GitHub Pages. The final Lighthouse scores were all **97 or higher**.
