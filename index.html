        If you've ever picked up a Rubik's Cube, spun it a few times, and then
        quietly set it down hoping no one noticed — it's okay, you're not
        alone. What started as a puzzle meant to teach 3D geometry has become
        one of the most iconic and beloved brain teasers of all time. Whether
        you're here to solve it, learn more about it, or just impress your
        friends, you're in the right place!

        <h2>A Bit of Cube History</h2>
        <p>
          The <strong>Rubik's Cube</strong> was invented in
          <strong>1974</strong> by Hungarian architect and professor
          <strong>Ernő Rubik</strong>. He originally called it the
          <i>Magic Cube</i> and used it as a teaching tool to help his students
          understand three-dimensional movement. It wasn't until a few years
          later, in <strong>1980</strong>, that it was rebranded as the “Rubik's
          Cube” and released internationally — quickly becoming a global
          sensation.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the mid-80s, over <strong>100 million cubes</strong> had been sold
          worldwide. The cube faded in popularity for a while but made a huge
          comeback in the early 2000s thanks to online tutorials, competitions,
          and an ever-growing speedcubing community.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="popularity" class="border-top mt-4 pt-3">
        <h2>Why Is It So Popular?</h2>
        <p>
          There's something fascinating about the cube's mix of simplicity and
          complexity. Just six colors, 54 stickers, and 43 quintillion possible
          combinations (yes, that's
          <strong>43,252,003,274,489,856,000</strong>!). And yet, no matter how
          scrambled it is, it can always be solved in
          <strong> 20 moves or fewer </strong> — a fact discovered by
          researchers and known as <strong>God's Number</strong>.
        </p>
        <h5>What makes the Rubik's Cube timeless?</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>It's tactile and satisfying to twist and turn.</li>
          <li>It appeals to problem-solvers and pattern lovers.</li>
          <li>It offers endless room for improvement and speed.</li>
          <li>It's a great brain workout and stress reliever.</li>

        <p>
          From kids learning their first algorithm to pros setting records on
          stage, the cube brings people together across ages and cultures. It's
          featured in movies, art, memes, and even
          <strong>robotics</strong> (check out our
          <a href="./speedcubing.html">Speedcubing page</a> for record-breaking

          Today, official competitions are held by the
          <strong>World Cube Association (WCA)</strong> in over 100 countries,
          with thousands of participants competing in over
          <strong>17 different cube events</strong> — including 2x2, 4x4,
          blindfolded solves, and even one-handed or with feet (though that
          event has been retired!).
