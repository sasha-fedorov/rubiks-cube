          <h4>🧩 Let's Talk About it</h4>
          <p>
            Whether you've solved it, scrambled it beyond recognition, or used
            it as a colorful desk decoration, the
            <strong>3x3 Rubik's Cube</strong> is instantly recognizable and
            surprisingly deep. It's a mix of logic, color, design, and
            frustration (in the best way possible).
          </p>
          <p>
            But where did it come from? And why does it continue to fascinate
            people around the world nearly 50 years after its invention? Let's
            dive in.
          </p>

        <section id="what-it-is" class="col-12">
          <h4>🧱 What Exactly <i>Is</i> a Rubik's Cube?</h4>
          <p>
            The standard 3x3 cube has <strong>6 faces</strong>, each made up of
            <strong>9 smaller squares</strong>, totaling
            <strong>54 stickers</strong>. The goal? Get all six sides to show
            just <strong>one solid color</strong>. Easier said than done!
          </p>
          <p>
            Inside, it's not just random blocks. The cube contains a clever
            mechanism allowing <strong>rotation in three dimensions</strong>,
            with:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>8 corner pieces</strong> (each showing 3 colors)</li>
            <li><strong>12 edge pieces</strong> (each showing 2 colors)</li>
            <li>
              <strong>6 fixed center pieces</strong> (which don't move and
              define the face color)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Because of its structure, the Rubik's Cube has exactly
            <strong>43,252,003,274,489,856,000</strong> possible configurations.
            That's over <strong>43 quintillion!</strong>

        <section id="history" class="col-12">
          <h4>🧠 A Quick History of the Cube</h4>
          <p>
            The cube was invented in <strong>1974</strong> by
            <strong>Ernő Rubik</strong>, a Hungarian professor of architecture.
            He didn't even design it as a puzzle at first—it was a teaching tool
            to demonstrate how objects can move in 3D space.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rubik quickly realized its puzzle potential. In
            <strong>1975</strong>, he patented the design, and by
            <strong>1980</strong>, it was released globally as the
            <strong>Rubik's Cube</strong>. The toy quickly became a cultural
            phenomenon.
          </p>
          <h6>🚀 Cube Craze in the 1980s:</h6>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Over <strong>100 million cubes</strong> were sold in just a few
              years.
            </li>
            <li>Magazines featured cube-solving guides.</li>
            <li>Puzzle books became bestsellers.</li>
            <li>A world championship was held in 1982 in Budapest.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Then... it faded out.</p>
          <h6>🔁 The 2000s Comeback:</h6>
          <p>
            Thanks to online tutorials, YouTube, and a growing
            <strong>speedcubing</strong>
            scene, the cube surged back into pop culture. Now, with newer cube
            designs and global competitions, it's more alive than ever.

          <h4>🌍 Why Is It So Popular?</h4>
          <p>
            The cube blends challenge with satisfaction. Solving it makes you

            <li>Or competing for speed —</li>
          </ul>
          <p>— it offers something for everyone.</p>
          <p>
            Even people who can't solve it still enjoy trying, turning, or just
            admiring it.
